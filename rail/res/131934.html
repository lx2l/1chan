I know&#44; liberal arts may sound jarring&#44; but I&#39;m a physics major and I really enjoy the perspective the liberal arts side has offered me. But right now&#44; I&#39;m feeling like the whole college idea doesn&#39;t work for me. It&#39;s not that I&#39;m doing poorly&#44; it&#39;s that I&#39;m losing motivation and really questioning whether this is what I want my life to continue being. I recently realized that this continuous climb will be my reality should I stay in academics.</p><p>Oddly enough&#44; with the prior considered&#44; I&#39;m thinking of venturing into a career as opposed to my current career path. The particular: working on a railroad&#44; preferably as a conductor. I was discussing careers with my professor one day&#44; and he asked me what kind of job kid-me would want to have. With good intention to sound like a physicist&#44; I said I would want to work on research in either applied or theoretical physics (I know&#44; incredibly general&#44; but I prefer not to disclose the topics with the intent to keep anonymity). But little did the professor know&#44; subconsciously I thought about a K-5 dream of being a conductor. Weird&#44; right?</p><p>So now&#44; maybe as some form of escapism or a conscious fast-track to my future&#44; I want to know if anyone has had experience with the railroad industry and/or have worked as a conductor/know someone who was/is a conductor. How do I go about this&#44; and will my application to this career being dismissed considering I don&#39;t have a degree yet? What do you think? Would an academic like myself hate the notion of working as a conductor? </p><p>I know this post will probably receive a lot of ridicule&#44; but I&#39;m ready for it.</p>  </blockquote>       <table><tbody><tr><td class="doubledash">&gt;&gt;</td> <td class="reply" id="reply131935"> <a name="131935"></a> <label><input type="checkbox" name="delete" value="131935" /> <span class="replytitle"></span>  <span class="commentpostername">Tex</span><span class="postertrip">!S0C7KLz8n.</span> Sat Feb 13 23:35:57 2016</label> <span class="reflink">  <a href="javascript:insert('&gt;&gt;131935')">No.131935</a> </span>&nbsp;  <blockquote> <p>Welcome to the funny farm! You&#39;ll find that there&#39;s a handful of us here that are professional railroaders in a few different crafts.</p><p>So you want to be a conductor&#44; eh? Unfortunately&#44; this very moment doesn&#39;t seem to be a terribly good time to try to hire on. The railroads are in a downswing due to traffic not meeting their expected demands. However&#44; we can help you get started so you&#39;ll know what to do when the time comes.</p><p>Here&#39;s the thing that concerns me the most:</p><blockquote class="unkfunc">&gt;Would an academic like myself hate the notion of working as a conductor?</blockquote><p>That&#39;s a very good question. The number one thing you need to know about working for any railroad is that the vast majority of them don&#39;t have set schedules. You can and will be frequently called at any time day or night. The only restrictions are that you have to be &quot;rested&quot;&#44; which is federal jargon for &quot;he&#39;s been off duty long enough&quot;. You&#39;ll often find that you&#39;ll come home&#44; get your eight hours&#39; &quot;rest&quot;&#44; get some good sleep&#44; and then you sit around all day waiting for a call. Nothing happens until your day is gone&#44; you&#39;re just starting to get tired again&#44; and at the time you consider going back to bed&#44; your employer will call you and want you to work a job that can last up to 12 hours. Repeat ad nauseum for five to ten years until you build up enough seniority to hold down a specific job that&#44; even if the schedule is crappy&#44; gives you a better idea of when you&#39;re going to work.</p><p>Also&#44; if you have a significant other&#44; be prepared to spend a lot of time away from them while you&#39;re out on the road or resting in a hotel at an away from home terminal.</p><p>I&#39;ll let everyone else get into the details of actually applying&#44; but I wanted to give you a heads up of what you&#39;re getting into.</p>  </blockquote> </td></tr></tbody></table>     <table><tbody><tr><td class="doubledash">&gt;&gt;</td> <td class="reply" id="reply131937"> <a name="131937"></a> <label><input type="checkbox" name="delete" value="131937" /> <span class="replytitle"></span>  <span class="commentpostername">aGEisfinetoo</span> Sun Feb 14 03:42:25 2016</label> <span class="reflink">  <a href="javascript:insert('&gt;&gt;131937')">No.131937</a> </span>&nbsp;  <blockquote> <p><a href="131934.html#131935" onclick="highlight(131935)">&gt;&gt;131935</a></p><p>This is roughly what a scoutmaster from a neighboring troop said to me when I was 12 years old and expressed excitement at how cool his job must be as a trainmaster for NS.
